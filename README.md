<br>
<p><strong>My process</strong></p>

<p> Just downloaded the project directions and started coding. Did a lot of research everytime I got stuck...</p>
<p><strong>Built with </strong></p>
<p>Visual Studio Code for coding and Responsively Web Browser to view the variety of medias and responsiveness adjustments.</p>
<br>
HTML5 markup | CSS custom properties | Flexbox | Mobile-first workflow
<br>

<h3>What I learned</h3>
<p>Despite a newbie challenge, I learned a lot about placing things on screen. Had a lot of struggle to place the background images and the avatar inside the card. It took a lot of research. Again the browser developer tools helped to understand how things work.</p>

<p>I'm still pretty happy with the results of my work and looking foward to the new challenges ahead.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Useful resources</strong></p>
<p> Lots research in this one, a very challenging piece of work.</p>
